    "## Law Scoring System\n",
    "\n",
    "The core of the data engineering work is the construction of a law strength scoring system that translates many individual law changes into a single nuneric indicator (and related features) of the firearm policy environment for each state-year.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design Choices and rationale\n",
    "\n",
    "The law database contains one row per law, with:\n",
    "  - Whether the law is **Restrictive** (tightens guns regulations) or **Permissive** (loosens regulations) -- stored in `effect`.\n",
    "  - What type of change occured -- `type_of_change` (e.g., `Implement`, `Modify`, or `Repeal`).\n",
    "\n",
    "To turn this into a consistent, interpretable score, we used a simple symmetric scoring scheme:\n",
    "  - Restrictive law implementation/modification -> +1\n",
    "  - Permissive law implementation/modification -> -1\n",
    "  - Repeal of a restrictive law -> -1\n",
    "  - Repeal of a permissive law -> +1\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, for each law row we defined:\n",
    "\n",
    "```r\n",
    "law_scores <- law_data2 %>%\n",
    "  mutate(\n",
    "    law_score = case_when(\n",
    "      effect == \"Restrictive\" & type_of_change %in% c(\"Implement\", \"Modify\") ~ 1,\n",
    "      effect == \"Permissive\" & type_of_change %in% c(\"Implement\", \"Modify\") ~ -1,\n",
    "      type_of_change == \"Repeal\" & effect == \"Restrictive\" ~ -1,\n",
    "      type_of_change == \"Repeal\" & effect == \"Permissive\" ~ 1,\n",
    "      TRUE ~ 0\n",
    "    )\n",
    "  ) %>%\n",
    "  filter(law_score != 0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Why this makes sense:\n",
    "  - The sign captures the direction of the change:\n",
    "      - Positive values indicate the law makes the environment more restrictive overall.\n",
    "      - Negative values indicate the law makes the environment becomes more permissive overall.\n",
    "  - The magnitude (fixed at 1) assumes each law change contributes equally to the net policy climate. This is a simplification but has two advantages:\n",
    "      - It keeps the measure easy to interpret: the total is just the net count of \"restrictive minus permissive\" actions.\n",
    "      - It avoids having to arbitrarily weight different law classes without strong prior justification.\n",
    "  - Repeals are handled symmetrically:\n",
    "      - Repealing a restrictive law undoes restrictive policy, so it moves the environment in a more permissive direction (-1).\n",
    "      - Repealing a permissive law decreases permissiveness, effectively making the environnment more restrictive (+1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Cases where the `effect` and `type_of_change` could not be clearly categorized (e.g. \"See note\") are assigned a score of 0 and then removed before aggregation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```r\n",
    "filter(law_score != 0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This avoids forcing ambiguous entries into one direction or the other."
